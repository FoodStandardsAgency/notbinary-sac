# Statutory Advisory Committee Microsites Discovery


<img src="https://github.com/notbinary/discovery-template/blob/master/Assets/DiscoveryLogo.png" width=120px/>

## Welcome!

This wiki contains documentation describing the SAC Discovery Service. It is intended to be a place where the squad (team) can keep track of progress and document their findings from the discovery. It is also intended to be a 'homepage' where the squad can signpost to data and information that exists elsewhere.

## Service

The Scientific Advisory Committees (SAC) provide independent, expert advice and challenge to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) on risk assessment and other scientific issues. The Committees are comprised of around 100 independent experts appointed through open competition, including 35 members newly appointed this year. Under the Committees are there Joint Expert Groups (JEG) that provide specific risk assessment advice on regulated products, which will need their own sites. 

The existing SAC websites are poorly branded, outdated, difficult to navigate and inconsistent in content. They do not meet accessibility standards and risk breaching the legislative requirements, which may lead to legal ramifications.
[Insert a brief overview of the service]

(Service-overview)

## Policy & legislation

The SAC's are independent of the FSA and as such the sites need to reflect this. The individual SAC's have their own Terms of Reference. These are available on the current sites and will be available on their new sites. The sites do not need to follow gov.uk styling although where applicable components built for the FSA site will be re-used. The fact that they are independent is key in ascertaining public trust in their decision making process.

## Users

Website Admin - internal
Works as part of the Secretariat. Generally poorly trained and have low skills in Drupal. Use site infrequently and struggle to complete simple tasks. New page creation can take 2-3 hours as it's not logical or simple to follow. Have no guidance manuals. Generally update meeting pages, upload relevant documents (pdf’s) and amend Member pages. Look after their own site but could be pooled if sites were consistent. 

FSA Staff researching
Use the microsites as a document repository for research purposes. Require functionality over design. Have learnt where most documents are and which committee page to search. Use Google search over site search. 

General Public
Limited use, but would normally follow press reports on a particular issue. Would find it hard to navigate and find information and may be put off by the amateurish look of the sites. Accessibility needs to be considered. 

Journalists
Journalists will visit the sites infrequently but generally with a specific topic in mind. Take CBD as an example. Journalists will need to be assured that the SAC’s have provided expert advice that can be easily found for their reports. Journalists will not know the correct committee site to search. 

Vested Interest
Generally food companies or legal teams that have applied for approval or interested in a particular food stuff. Will want notification of meetings and papers related to their items. They may also follow items from competitors. Occasionally these reports will not be published and private decisions will be sent. 

SAC Members
Rarely visit the sites as meeting agendas and papers are emailed to them. Members have profiles and bios which need to be updated by the website admin. Members also complete a register of interest which is normally only updated after the annual meeting. This is held within the pdf meeting notes.

## Operations

Each SAC has it's own Secretariat which manage the microsites. This has led to differences in each of the sites, which although look similar are quite different in structure and content. There is not a huge amount to say on Operations. Meetings are held quarterly, agenda and papers are published to the website. After the meeting minutes and decisions are published to the sites. As this is quarterly and as training has been limited these quite simple tasks can take many hours. it is a task that the secretariats almost have to relearn every time. Otherwise it is adding news items, keeping member details up to date and adding annual board meeting reports. It is quite a basic process that takes too long and has become too difficult to have a central pool of staff that can manage all sites due to their differences. This has led to having a few single points of failure that needs to be addressed.

## Technology

For the purposes of this project, the SAC's used Drupal. This project will upgrade them to Drupal 8, whilst redesigning their sites.

## Data

For the purposes of this project we are only looking at data held on the current microsites. Whilst information on these sites is limited there each contain multiple pdf's in some cases going back into the 1990's. The sites are used as a document repository.

## Recommendations

The next step, already commissioned, is for Deeson to implement Drupal 8 with new branding and a more consistent layout and feel of the individual SAC's. The branding will be modernised and the sites made to look more professional with much improved search functionality as this is by far the most common usage.
