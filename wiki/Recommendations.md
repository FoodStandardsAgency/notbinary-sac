Key themes and recommendations for the service

In general the key feedback has been around the functionality of the sites. The sites are predominantly used as a repository for documents relating to meetings, agendas and decisions. These are currently added as pdf documents, although a small number of SACâ€™s do write the agenda out on a web page with links to the relevant docs further down the page.  
This task should take around 15-30 mins but often takes over three hours due to the complexities of the current CMS and the low level of Drupal skill within the Secretariats that look after each of the SACs.

Internally the correct documents are often found by Googling the committee name and the food stuff being searched for. This brings back better results than using the actual search functionality of the microsties themselves. Search results on the microsites returns you to an FSA web page and is quite poor.

This is fine if you know the SAC you need to search for. Being able to search across all microsites would be a desirable feature. 

As well as looking at the accessibility of the sites, which is the key driver of the project, this search functionality is key to the staff of the SAC's and needs to have good usability for the new sites to be adopted with ease.
