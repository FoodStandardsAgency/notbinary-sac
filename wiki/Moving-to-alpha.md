From the Discovery the project was handed over to Deeson. Not Binary acted as an additional PM to assist SAC staff in their first digital project and to ensure continuity of delivery from the discovery. For Alpha, Beta and MoSCoW please see Deeson pages. With a limited budget not all of the functionality requested by staff could be delivered through this project. Again the main driver was improving accessibility of the sites which took preference over some of the functionality requested.
